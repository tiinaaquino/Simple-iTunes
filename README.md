# Simple-iTunes

For this project, we will write a basic mp3 player.  The program loads mp3 files from a given directory (and its 
subdirectories), extract tags from the mp3 files (title and artist) using an external library called jAudiotagger, 
and then display the sorted list of songs on the panel. The user should be able to select a song and play it by clicking 
the Play button, or stop playing it at any time by clicking the Stop button. We will use the JavaZOOM JLayer library to 
play the mp3 files. The songs should be sorted by title, and the user should be able to search for songs bytyping the word 
that the title should start with. For this project, we are required to internally store songs in a custom Linked List (we  
may  not  use  a  LinkedList  class  from  Java  standard  library;  or  any  other implementations of a LinkedList).
